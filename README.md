Detecting deepfakes is crucial for maintaining the integrity of digital content and preventing the spread of misleading or fraudulent information. Various methods are employed for deep fake detection,
including forensic analysis, anomaly detection, and the use of machine learning algorithms to recognize subtle inconsistencies and artifacts in manipulatedÂ media.
